On the Solana blockchain, a token has 3 different authorities:

- Update Authority allows you to update the token metadata. When we revoke it, we make the token "immutable".

- Freeze Authority allows you to freeze the token in the holder's wallet. You can't create a liquidity pool if you don't revoke the freezing authority.

- Mint Authority allows you to mint more supply of the token you created.

- NAME AND SYMBOL: Regarding names and abbreviations, it's best to carry the name of your project. You should look for a meaningful name that has never been used before, but at the same time is easy to remember for the person who sees or hears it. Marketing strategies start to operate from the choice of your token's name, especially if it's a Meme Coin. The humor or parody can be contained in the name itself!

- DESCRIPTION: The description is where you present the idea behind the creation of the token, write something related to the nature of the meme in a few words.

- DECIMALS: The decimal number can vary from 0 to 9. Usually, if you want to create a meme coin for your project, you should use the number between 6 and 9. The most common is 6.

- SUPPLY: The supply is one of the most important parts, as we have to organize the financial landscape, this decision is closely linked with the Tokenomics of your project.

- LOGO IMAGE: This is also one of the factors that identify the brand and attract investors' attention, so we should focus on creating something unique and different. Could someone share your meme?
